      <h1>Welcome to Lidcombe Preschool Kindergarten!</h1>
      <p>Lidcombe Preschool Kindergarten is located in Western Sydney. It is owned and operated by Mrs Bala - a dedicated professional with over 30 years of experience in the industry, operating 2 long day centres and an OOSH centre in Sydney. Lidcombe Pre School Kindergarten is committed to providing a range of early childhood services which demonstrate excellence in the education and care of young children.
</p><p>We provide a warm, loving and secure environment, which is absolutely essential to their growth and development. There’s nothing more important to you than the health and happiness of your child, which is why our staff are fully devoted to achieving exactly that every single day. We have the only world-class academic program which is aligned to the Australian Primary school curriculum in order to ensure that your child starts school with all the pre-primary skills and dispositions to succeed in the future.
</p>             
     <p> Lidcombe Preschool Kindergarten understands what it is you’re searching for in a childcare centre: a stimulating, nurturing, safe environment, with qualified and caring professionals. It all comes down to ‘the vibe’ one gets when entering our child care centres – a sort of happy, busy-calm balance.
